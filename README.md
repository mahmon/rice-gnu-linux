# Rice GNU/Linux
The aim of this repo is to record a process for the complete beginner to follow to get started with GNU/Linux. This is an edited record of my move from MacOS to GNU/Linux. It is a live document that is updated as I refine the process and my learning.

**NOTE: The process to follow is documented in [the repo wiki](https://github.com/mahmon/rice-gnu-linux/wiki/00-Introduction "Rice GNU/Linux wiki")**

This repo contains config files and resources used in the process, especially those I use ricing arch.
